## Telemetry Channels

1. Altitude (km)
2. Velocity (km/s)
3. Latitude (degrees)
4. Longitude (degrees)
5. Attitude Roll (degrees)
6. Attitude Pitch (degrees)
7. Attitude Yaw (degrees)
8. Battery Voltage (V)
9. Battery Current (A)
10. Solar Array Current (A)
11. Temperature Internal (°C)

## Traffic Light Rules (EID)

GREEN (Nominal):
- Battery voltage: 26-28.5V
- Attitude: ±2°
- Internal temp: 18-28°C
- Comm signal: >80%
- Altitude: 380-420km

YELLOW (Caution):
- Battery voltage: 24.5-26V
- Attitude: 2-4°
- Internal temp: 15-18°C or 28-30°C
- Comm signal: <80%
- Altitude: 360-380km or 420-440km

RED (Warning):
- Battery voltage: <24.5V
- Attitude: >4°
- Internal temp: <15°C or >30°C

## Update Rate
- Simulation: 10 Hz (100ms)
- GUI refresh: 10 Hz (100ms)
- Data synchronization: Thread-safe locks

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
✓ Windows (tested)
✓ macOS (compatible)
✓ Linux (compatible)

## Execution Options

1. Double-click run.bat (Windows)
2. Run launcher.py (all platforms)
3. Run control_gui.py directly
4. Run eid_gui.py directly
5. Test telemetry_generator.py in terminal
